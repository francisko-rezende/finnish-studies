# Finnish studies notes

## General info:

This repo contains the notes that I'm making while studying Finnish. 

I'm stuyding using the "Suomen Mestari" book series.

I'm taking said notes using sublime text/latex, using a modular file system based on the *subfile* package. In order to compile the file for a given book, run the *p채채-sm-n.tex* file found within each book's directory.

**NOTE**: I'm using *n* to denote a generic number in this README.
